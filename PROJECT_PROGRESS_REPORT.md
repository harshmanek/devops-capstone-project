| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 27/12/25 | Project repository structure reviewed; initial environment setup; verified Python and Docker versions.                                                                                                                          |
| 28/12/25 | Implemented microservices skeleton for `user-service`, `product-service`, and `order-service`; added `requirements.txt` and basic `app.py` files.                                                                               |
| 29/12/25 | Added initial Kubernetes manifests (deployments, services, namespace) and basic Helm/manifest notes in `k8s/`.                                                                                                                  |
| 30/12/25 | Created initial CI/CD workflow drafts and planned GitHub Actions jobs for build/test/deploy.                                                                                                                                    |
| 31/12/25 | Added basic test helper scripts including `test_all_services.sh` and smoke-test steps.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01/01/26 | Optimized Dockerfiles with multi-stage builds to reduce final image size.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 02/01/26 | Added `.dockerignore` files for each service and created a repo-level `.gitignore`; added code quality workflow (`code-quality.yml`).                                                                                           |
| 03/01/26 | Updated Kubernetes manifests to support images pushed to GHCR and created `GITHUB_SETUP_GUIDE.md` with registry setup instructions.                                                                                             |
| 04/01/26 | Implemented `setup-cicd.sh` to generate GitHub Actions workflows and helper files automatically (initial version).                                                                                                              |
| 05/01/26 | Fixed path issues in `setup-cicd.sh` by introducing `PROJECT_ROOT` and corrected Dockerfile target paths and `.dockerignore` creation.                                                                                          |
| 06/01/26 | Reviewed monitoring plan and prepared `setup-monitoring.sh` to deploy Prometheus + Grafana via Helm and to create ServiceMonitors, dashboards, and alert rules.                                                                 |
| 07/01/26 | Ran `setup-monitoring.sh`; changed `helm install` to `helm upgrade --install` for idempotency; verified Prometheus and Grafana are deployed and healthy; started Grafana port-forward and confirmed health endpoint (HTTP 200). |
| 08/01/26 | Configured Grafana dashboards as a ConfigMap and applied Prometheus alert rules; validated ServiceMonitor resources for each service.                                                                                           |
| 09/01/26 | Performed final workflow/lint checks; ensured CI workflows (build, test, deploy, API tests) are present and references are correct.                                                                                             |
| 10/01/26 | Finalized documentation and setup guides; ensured scripts are idempotent and updated instructions for next steps (port-forward, viewing dashboards, GitHub secrets).                                                            |
